# Front-End-Developer-Test

## A brief description of your project.
The project was quite an interesting and challenging one. I implemented this using React Js and there are couples of libraries I installed to help me with the challenge. I installed React Bootstrap and Styled Component for the design, React Router for managing my routes, React Axios for my API Calls and React Fontaweson for font management.

## How long did it take?
I was time constraint because of the tasks in my current place of work. I spent 2hours daily for a period of 5 days working on the application.

## Which part was the hardest to implement?
It's an interesting project, I really did not find any part difficult to implement. This is because I have some experience building React Aplications.

## What functionalities are you most proud of?
I was excited that I was able to replicate the design in the figma Project. Being a fan of football, I found the API really interesting but time wasn't on my side so I could not use most of the API resources as much as I wanted to.
