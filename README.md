# Front-End-Developer-Test

## A brief description of your project.
The project was quite an interesting and challenging one. I implemented this using React Js and there are couples of libraries I installed to help me with the challenge. I installed React Bootstrap and Styled Component for the design, React Router for managing my routes, Axios for my API Calls and React Fontawesome for font management.

I was able to implemted the Figma design using React Boostrap and Styled Component. I also ensured that my design was responsive across different devices using React Boostrap Flex and Media Query. 

I tried as much to split the application into various component and made comments where necessary in my code.

One other major implementation was consuming the API. A click on one of the Competition Link will fetch some basic features of the competition like tables and fixtures. 

Github was my major Resource Management Tool. I was able to host the project on Heroku :  https://bytework-football-reactapp.herokuapp.com

The below GIF shows the functionality of the Project.

## How long did it take?
There was time constraint because of the tasks in my current place of work. I spent 2hours daily for a period of 5 days working on the application.

## Which part was the hardest to implement?
It's an interesting project, I really did not find any part difficult to implement. This is because I have some experience building React Aplications.

## What functionalities are you most proud of?
I was excited that I was able to replicate the design in the figma Project. Being a fan of football, I found the API really interesting but time wasn't on my side so I could not use most of the API resources as much as I wanted to.
